# JavaScript Tutorial

This is a simple to-do list application I wrote in order to be used when I
taught a class General Assemb.ly about JavaScript and how to build
applications with it.

The topics discussed using this app were:

* Functions
* Constructors
* DOM API
* Scope (global vs local)
* IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
* HTML Forms
* Writing documentation
* Naming Conventions
* Keeping your code DRY
* Making your code modularized and reusable
